# 2048UI

This is a project from Tampere University Programming 2: Structures course. The action logic of the program was provided as a template and the graphical user interface is my own work. I learned to design and implement gui with Qt and to use Qt documentation. I also practised modularity and learned how to separate user interface from the action logic of the program.

# 2048UI

This is a project from Tampere University Programming 2: Structures course. I implemented a graphical user interface for 2048 game. The action logic of the program was provided as a template. I learned to design and implement gui with Qt and to use Qt documentation. I also practised modularity and learned how to separate user interface from the action logic of the program.
